# Refinery Core

This repo contains core shared elements used both by Engines repo and the API repo. This covers stuff like `configProvider`, `IRecord` interface and `Record` class as well as SQL utils and general utility functions (including logger instance).

#TODO: integrate this repo with Engines and discontinue committing here
